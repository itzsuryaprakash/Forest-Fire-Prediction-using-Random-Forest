# Forest-Fire-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
### Project Overview
This project implements a Random Forest regression model to predict the occurrence and spread of forest fires based on environmental factors. The dataset includes attributes such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rainfall. By analyzing these variables, the Random Forest model provides accurate predictions, helping in early fire detection and prevention strategies. This project highlights the effectiveness of ensemble learning in handling regression tasks and making reliable predictions.
